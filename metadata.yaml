description: Once upon a time, not so very many years ago, there lived three ducks
  in a duck pen. And this pen was not far from where Sammie and Susie Littletail,
  the rabbit children, had their burrow, and it was close to the trees where Johnnie
  and Billie Bushytail, the squirrel brothers, learned to jump from their nest. Now
  I am going to tell you some stories about these ducks, and what they did. To begin
  with there was the mamma duck.
